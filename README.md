## Quick StartüöÄ
### Create a Gatsby site
Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site,
```sh
gatsby new <directory name> https://github.com/Akihide-Tsue/Tsue.com
```
### Start Developing
Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.
```sh
cd <directory name>
npm run develop
```
### Open the source code and start editing!
Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.
 This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Open the `blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/templates/index-template.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
### some notes about the config
You need to create a .env.development file, with the following env:
GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE=playground.
This will allow you to use Playground for your graphql IDE.
### Firebase Deploy
```sh
gatsby build
firebase deploy
```
